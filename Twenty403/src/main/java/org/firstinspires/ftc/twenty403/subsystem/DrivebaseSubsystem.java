        * Resulting in 52.48291908330528 in/s.
        * This is only 85% of the theoretical maximum velocity of the bot, following the recommendation above.
        * This is capped at 85% because there are a number of variables that will prevent your bot from actually
        * reaching this maximum velocity: voltage dropping over the game, bot weight, general mechanical inefficiencies, etc.
        * However, you can push this higher yourself if you'd like. Perhaps raise it to 90-95% of the theoretically
        * max velocity. The theoretically maximum velocity is 61.74461068624151 in/s.
        * Just make sure that your bot can actually reach this maximum velocity. Path following will be detrimentally
        * affected if it is aiming for a velocity not actually possible.
        *
        * The maximum acceleration is somewhat arbitrary and it is recommended that you tweak this yourself based on
        * actual testing. Just set it at a reasonable value and keep increasing until your path following starts
        * to degrade. As of now, it simply mirrors the velocity, resulting in 52.48291908330528 in/s/s
        *
        * Maximum Angular Velocity is calculated as: maximum velocity / trackWidth * (180 / Math.PI) but capped at 360Â°/s.
        * You are free to raise this on your own if you would like. It is best determined through experimentation.
